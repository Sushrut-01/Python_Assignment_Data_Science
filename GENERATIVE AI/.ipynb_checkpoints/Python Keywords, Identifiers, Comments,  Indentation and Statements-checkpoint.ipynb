    "#1-Explain the significance of Python keywords and provide examples of five keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes within the Python language.\n",
    "These keywords are integral to the syntax and structure of Python, and they cannot be used as identifiers (i.e., variable names, function names, etc.). Keywords help define the logic and control flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are examples of five Python keywords along with their significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1   if\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance: Used for conditional statements.\n",
    "It allows the execution of code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    " print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "2.  for\n",
    "Significance: Used for looping over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It \n",
    "allows repeated execution of a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "3.   def\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance: Used to define a function. It allows the creation of reusable blocks of code that can be called with parameters.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "4 \n",
    "return\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance: Used inside a function to exit the function and return a value to the caller. \n",
    "It allows a function to send back a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "5\n",
    "import\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance: Used to include external modules or libraries into a Python script. It allows the use of functions, classes, \n",
    "and variables defined in other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0\n",

    "    \n",
    "Start with a letter or underscore: Identifiers must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "Followed by letters, digits, or underscores: After the initial character, the identifier can contain letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.\n",
    "Case-sensitive: Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable and myvariable are considered different.\n",
    "No spaces or special characters: Identifiers cannot contain spaces or special characters like @, #, !, etc.\n",
    "Not a reserved keyword: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python keywords or reserved words (e.g., if, else, for, while, class, def).\n",
    "    \n",

    "        \n",

    "is important in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " Readability: Indentation makes code more readable by visually separating different levels of code blocks. It helps developers quickly understand the structure and flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Requirement: Python uses indentation to indicate the beginning and end of code blocks, unlike languages that use curly braces {} or keywords like end. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or unintended behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Structure: Proper indentation ensures that code blocks such as loops and conditional statements are correctly nested and executed according to their intended logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability: Consistent and proper indentation makes it easier to maintain and modify code over time. It helps other developers (and your future self) understand the code's logic and make changes efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Proper Indentation:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Example of a function with proper indentation\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    if len(name) > 0:\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",

    "        In these examples:\n",

    "The greet function and the for loop demonstrate proper indentation.\n",
    "Each level of indentation (typically four spaces per level) denotes a nested code block.\n",

    "Common Indentation Rules in Python:\n",
    "Use four spaces per indentation level as per Python's style guide (PEP 8), though some prefer to use tabs.\n",
    "Be consistent throughout your codebaseâ€”mixing tabs and spaces or inconsistent levels of indentation can lead to confusion and errors.\n",
    "Ensure all lines within the same block are aligned correctly; indentation errors can cause syntax errors or alter the program's logic.\n",

If the indentation is not aligned correctly or mixed inconsistently (e.g., using tabs and spaces interchangeably), Python will raise an IndentationError. \n",
    "For example:\n",

    "3-Unexpected Code Execution: Improper indentation can cause Python to interpret code blocks differently than intended. It may result in unintended code execution paths or cause parts of your code to be skipped entirely.\n",
    "Example of Incorrect Indentation and Its Consequence:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    IndentationError: expected an indented block\n",
    "In this example, the print(\"This line should be indented\") statement should be indented properly under the if statement. Since it's not, Python raises an IndentationError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices to Avoid Indentation Issues:\n",
    "Consistent Indentation: Use either spaces or tabs consistently throughout your codebase. Mixing them can lead to confusion and errors.\n",

    "In Python, expressions and statements are \n",
    "fundamental components of code, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Expressions:\n",
    "An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be a single value, a function call that returns a value, or a combination of values and operators that evaluates to a single value.\n",

    "Characteristics of Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be composed of variables, constants, operators, and function calls.\n",
    "They always evaluate to a value.\n",
    "They can be used within larger expressions or assignments.\n",
    "Examples of Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Arithmetic Expression:\n",
    "    x = 10 + 5  # Addition is an expression that evaluates to 15\n",
    "2-Function Call:\n",
    "    result = len(\"hello\")  # len(\"hello\") is an expression that evaluates to 5\n",

    "\n",
    "    Statements:\n",
    "A statement is a unit of code that performs some action. It is a complete instruction that Python can execute,\n",
    "and it often changes the state of a program (e.g., by assigning values, looping, or branching).\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "They are complete lines of code that perform actions such as variable assignments, function definitions, loops, conditionals, etc.\n",
    "They can include expressions, but they are not required to produce a value themselves.\n",
    "Examples of Statements:\n",
    "    \n",

    "  1-  Assignment Statement:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Positive number\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Non-positive number\")\n",

    "    print(i)  # This is a statement that prints the value of i in each iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "    Key Differences:\n",
    "Purpose: Expressions produce values, while statements execute actions or commands.\n",
    "Usage: Expressions are used within statements or other expressions. Statements are executed sequentially to perform tasks.\n",
    "Evaluation: Expressions are evaluated \n",
    "to produce a result. \n",
    "Statements do not necessarily produce a value (though they may affect values through assignments\n",

    "\n",
